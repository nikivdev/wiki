title: My file system
---

Below is how my file system looks like. As output from [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza).

<Callout>
  It's bit messy and the strucutre is changing often so this is just a snapshot
  of how it looked like in the past. I will eventually update it more often.

## ~/src

```
api  c  cli  config  deno  elixir  ext  games  generated  go  help  kotlin  lean  mojo  moonbit  nikiv  nix  ocaml  odin  org  other  pause  py  rust  scala  snippets  swift  tools  ts  ui  i  zig
```

Majority of `~/src` is open source and is shared and explained in [GitHub bio](https://github.com/nikivdev)

## ~/

```
ai            bin      contexts  Desktop    done       gh     Library  media   notes     past      pr           run                       sites  test-ledger  ui          xcode

```

## ~/Documents

```
apps  books  mmkv  sort
```

Above is like this only as I try to structure what's in `sort` folder (old `~/Documents`) better.

```
apps  audio  audio-books  books  design  docs  huggingface  images  invoices  la  learn  music  org  other  papers  pdf  personal  presentations  process  processing  slideshow  tax  use  video  web-archives  zoom
```
