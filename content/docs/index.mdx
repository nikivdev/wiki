Personal wiki of [Nikita](https://nikiv.dev). It's [open source](https://github.com/nikivdev/wiki).

Will be moved to [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) once its built.

Using this wiki to research & keep notes on things. I have many notes in [Reflect](https://reflect.app) now as its bit nicer to edit but LA will soon be Reflect quality so most of my notes will be public.
