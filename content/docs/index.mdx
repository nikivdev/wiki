Personal wiki of [Nikita](https://nikiv.dev). It's [open source](https://github.com/nikivdev/wiki).

Will be moved to [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) once its built.

Using this wiki to research & keep notes on things. I have many notes in [Reflect](https://reflect.app) now as its bit nicer to edit but LA will soon be Reflect quality so most of my notes will be public.

As this wiki is only getting started, you can check [my old wiki](https://wiki-old.nikiv.dev) which was quite large. I had it paywalled for some pages but you can unblock by visiting [this page](https://wiki-old.nikiv.dev/thanks).
